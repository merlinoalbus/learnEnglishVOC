# nginx.conf 
#This is the Nginx configuration file for serving a React application
# It includes gzip compression, security headers, and caching for static assets
# It also handles React Router for single-page applications (SPA) by redirecting all requests to index.html
# The configuration is designed to optimize performance and security for the application
# Use Nginx as the base image for serving the application
# It listens on port 80 and serves the application from the /usr/share/nginx/html
# The server_name is set to localhost, and the root directory is specified
# The index files are set to index.html and index.htm
# The gzip compression is enabled for various content types to reduce bandwidth usage
# The configuration includes security headers to protect against common vulnerabilities 

# It also sets up caching for static assets to improve load times
# The location block handles requests, trying to serve files directly or falling back to index.html for React Router
# Error pages are configured to redirect 404 errors to index.html, allowing the React application to handle routing
# The configuration is suitable for production environments and can be used with Docker for containerization
